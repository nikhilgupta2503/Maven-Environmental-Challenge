Apple, a tech giant renowned for innovation, has set ambitious sustainability goals. They pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030, starting from a baseline of 38.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions in 2015. My analysis using Power BI forecasting methods indicates that they are on track to surpass this target with a projected reduction of nearly 91.13% by 2030.
